# covid-19_data_-analysis using pandas , matplotlib and seaborn
## Overview
This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis on country-wise COVID-19 data. The dataset includes information on active cases, deaths, recovery rates, and other relevant metrics. The analysis utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate multiple graphs and charts to visualize the data.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

1. Python (version 3.7 or higher)
2. Pandas (version 1.0.0 or higher)
3. Matplotlib (version 3.0.0 or higher)
4. Seaborn (version 0.10.0 or higher)
5. Dataset
## The dataset used for this analysis contains COVID-19 data for various countries. It includes the following columns:

1. Country: The name of the country
2. Date: The date when the data was recorded
3. Active Cases: The number of active COVID-19 cases in the country
4. Deaths: The number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the country
5. Recovery Rate: The percentage of recovered cases out of the total confirmed cases
6. New cases	
7. New deaths
8. 	New recovered	
9. 	Deathsrate	
10. 	Recoveredrate

## Usage

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running the following command:

## Results
Running the script will generate various graphs and charts to visualize the COVID-19 data. The generated visualizations provide insights into the trends, patterns, and distribution of active cases, deaths, and recovery rates across different countries. These visualizations can help in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on a country-wise basis.
